# Redis Desktop Manager Documentation

Redis Desktop Manager (aka RDM)â€” is a cross-platform open source Redis DB management tool (i.e. Admin GUI). Redis Desktop Manager developed to replace hundreds of slow and ugly tools for redis.

This is an early beta version of Redis Desktop Manager, that we are publishing in a hope to validate usefulness of application. We really welcome your feedback! Please submit any issues and proposals to GitHub.
